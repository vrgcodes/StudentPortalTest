# Detention Management System

This repository contains a full detention management system built to replace manual, spreadsheet-based systems used in school administration.

The goal of the project was to reduce administrative work and make detention tracking reliable and easy for both prefects and senior staff.

Rather than focusing on features for their own sake, the system was designed around real operational pain points observed in day-to-day use as Head Boy of my high school.

## Why this system exists

Before this system, detention management relied heavily on:
- Manually maintained spreadsheets
- Word-of-mouth communication
- Repeated cross-checking of attendance and names
- High risk of inconsistencies and lost records

This project was built to centralize all of that into a single, consistent system with clear ownership and accountability.

## System overview

The system supports the full detention lifecycle:

- Recording detentions
- Searching students without needing exact name matches
- Tracking attendance automatically
- Updating records in real time
- Providing administrators with oversight and verification tools
- Providing students with access to past papers and an AI study bot.

It is designed to be used daily, not as a one-off tool.

## Architecture

The system is structured as a web-based application with:

- A backend handling data storage, validation, and permissions
- A frontend focused on speed, clarity, and ease of use
- Role-based access for prefects and administrators

The emphasis throughout was reliability and simplicity rather than
over-engineering.

## What I learned

This project taught me a lot about:
- Designing systems around real constraints and users
- Balancing simplicity with flexibility
- Thinking about software as an operational tool
- Maintaining clarity as a system grows beyond a single script
- HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, AWS, and SQL.

## Notes

The program might not execute completely as the AWS server it was linked to was shut down.
